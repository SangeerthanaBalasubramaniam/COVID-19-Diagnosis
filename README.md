Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques in effectively detection and classification Covid-19

Possessing an enormous growth rate with an imperfect understanding of the transmission process, the virus is nurtured inside the human body with little or no symptoms, eventually leading to fatal consequences. Having methods for a quick diagnosis and detection of Covid-19 cases is imperative to direct people for treatment and proper care and thus contributing to limiting the disease's spread. A large amount of CT data provides a comprehensible analysis of the diagnosis process which in turn produces remarkable quantification and categorization of the severity of the virus inside the afflicted. 

The main purpose of this project is to use computer vision and machine learning techniques in effectively detecting and classifying Covid-19. Categorical data will be trained with a collection of CT scans of Covid-19 positive patients and normal individuals and thus reduce the false positive to a great extent as a person affected should not be left undetected.
